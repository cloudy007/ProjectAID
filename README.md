<h3>1.1Introduction</h3>
<p>This project aims to simplify drone control by developing a system that recognizes human gestures to execute basic maneuvers such as moving up, down, left, and right. By leveraging gesture recognition technology, the project explores whether hands-free operation can enhance the usability and accessibility of drones. This project seeks to address these gaps by developing a robust gesture recognition algorithm that utilizes deep learning and image processing techniques. This project not only aims to push the boundaries of drone technology but also aspires to pave the way for more intuitive control systems in future human-machine interactions.</p>
